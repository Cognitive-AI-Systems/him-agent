## Quick install

There are two setup guides:

- [quick & short version](#quick-install) is here below.
- [extended version](./install.md).

Before cloning the repository, make sure Git LFS is installed (see [help](./install.md#step-2-install-git-lfs)). Then:

```bash

conda create --name dhtm python=3.9 numpy matplotlib jupyterlab ruamel.yaml tqdm wandb mock imageio seaborn
conda activate dhtm

# install with pip the packages that cannot be installed with conda
pip install hexy prettytable "pytest>=4.6.5"

#  cd to the hima subdirectory in the project root and install hima package
cd <project_root>
pip install -e .
```
